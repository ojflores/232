#CPTR 232




##Lab 1

####lab 1 includes only lab1v2.c
####only need to run make to compile it


##Lab 2

####lab2.c and lab22.c
####lab2.c covers merge sort
####lab22.c covers bubble sort
####only need to run make to compile them

##Lab 3: Heap sort
####lab3.c
####needs input.txt to run

##Lab 4

####both quicksort.c and lab4.c
####need input.txt to run quicksort

##Graph

####book1

##LAB 6

####stack.c, queue.c, and linkedlist.c
####need datastruct_queue.h for all three to run
####use stack.input // queue.input // linkedlist.input respectively as input

##Lab 7: Hashes

#### hash.c
#### use hash.input as input
#### like so, cat hash.input | ./hash
#### need datatruct.h to run

##Lab 8: Binary Search Tree

#### binary.c
#### need hash.input to run
#### use datatruct.h to run
#### like so, cat hash.input | ./binary
#### also ex_12.txt included i guess, not really sure where to turn those in

##Lab 9: Graph Algorithms

####struct.c
####use graph.input for input
